This is a simulator for testing the performance of different cache configurations for a processor. Initially a graduate program project, it is now being polished for general usage.

This currently runs from the console. To learn the commands, enter "h".

This program needs a trace file where each line is a read ('r') or write ('w') command followed by an address written in hexadecimal. These files should be stored in the traces folder. If you have none, you may generate a file to mimick a trace.
